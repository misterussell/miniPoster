# Mock-Twitter that implements the use of Backbone views for rendering.

- This project uses a Backendless server to manage data requests
- This is the first implementation of Backbone Views I have applied to a project thus-far
- XHR headers and app-unique codes are kept outside of this git repo for security purposes.
